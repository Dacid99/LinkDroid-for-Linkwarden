LinkDroid is an app to provide an easier experience using Linkwarden on android.
You can quickly the webapp and share links directly to your Linkwarden instance via the context menu.

The app works best on Android version 13 and above. On lower versions the colors of the webview are messed up.
If you know a fix for that please let me know!

You're always welcome to leave questions, feedback and issues in the repositories on gitlab and github.
